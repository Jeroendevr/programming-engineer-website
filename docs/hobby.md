## Hobby Projects
Some open project which I created and you can use or draw inspiration from. 

## Visual Studio Code
### Theme extension
For this editor I have ported a TextMate Theme to Visual Studio Code. This theme is a dark theme so it is easy on the eyes and provides good syntax highlighting on a variety of languages. Which helps debugging programs.

See [VSCode Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Programming-Engineer.birds-of-paradise) and [source](https://github.com/Jeroendevr/birds-of-paradise-vscode)

Some benefits over the "old" textMate theme include :
- Color Scheme matches complete interface
- Better token definition leading to better readability. (Using more defined lexical tokens)
  - Support for Python Docstrings
- Make use of Semantic Highlighting defined within Visual Studio Code (for use of classes and decorators)
