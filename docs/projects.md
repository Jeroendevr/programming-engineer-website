## Excel Automation
A lot of the projects involve Microsoft Excel in one way or the other, as it is the go-to application on most enterprise systems to do calculations and data analysis. However functionality related to Excel can also be applied to other Office 365 apps like Access and Word. 
### Custom Add-In
#### Restructuring datasets
A custom Excel add-in developed for a client. In order to reduce administrative burden, the Add-in provides a restructuring of a large dataset. After restructuring the output could be used directly into it's workflow. Saving the client hours of manual work.

### VBA - VisualBasic for Applications
Although for most 'real' software developers. VisualBasic for applications is not the primary tool of use. However most enterprise environments do use microsoft Excel as their primary data analysis tool. Because of this I have quite some experience in developing so called Macro's to automate repeating tasks especially focused on Excel (While applications like Word or Access are also possible)
