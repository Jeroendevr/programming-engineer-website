# Procedure

My work consist of developing existing software projects as part of a team or solo or starting new projects. 

## Principles
Primary and preferred way of working is as iterative as possible. Reason is to have frequent and small releases so the customer can give early and fast feedback.  As I believe in the ideas presented in the [Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org)

### TDD - Test Driven Development
One of my preferred methodologies is applying [Test Driven Development](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development). Leading to stable and testable software during the entire development process. Even when the project becomes bigger.
